  "The recipient Party shall accord the Confidential Information disclosed by the disclosing Party with at least as careful treatment as": "This contract clause means that if one party (the \"recipient\") receives confidential information from another party (the \"disclosing party\"), the recipient must protect that information with at least as much care as they use to protect their own confidential information.\n\nHere's the breakdown in plain English, with each legal term explained:\n\n- **\"The recipient Party\"**: This is the person or company receiving the confidential information.\n- **\"Shall accord\"**: This is formal legal language meaning \"must give\" or \"must provide.\"\n- **\"The Confidential Information\"**: Confidential information refers to any sensitive information that is shared under the contract, such as trade secrets, business plans, client lists, or any other proprietary data the disclosing party wants kept private. What counts as confidential is usually defined elsewhere in the contract [2][3][4].\n- **\"Disclosed by the disclosing Party\"**: The \"disclosing party\" is the person or company sharing (giving away) their confidential information.\n- **\"With at least as careful treatment as\"**: The recipient must protect the confidential information at least as well as they protect their own similar confidential information. This means if the recipient uses strong passwords, locks cabinets, or restricts access to their own secrets, they must do the same for the disclosing party’s secrets.\n\n**In summary:**  \nIf you receive confidential information from someone, you must treat it as carefully as you treat your own confidential information—never with less care. This is to make sure that sensitive information remains private and secure, helping to prevent accidental leaks or misuse [1][3][5].",
  "Each of the parties agrees that for five (5) years from the date of disclosure, the receiving Party agrees to limit disclosure of the disclosing": "This contract clause says that both parties promise, for five years after confidential information is shared, that the party receiving the information will only share it under certain limits.\n\n**Plain English Breakdown:**\n\n- **\"Each of the parties agrees...\"**  \n  Both sides in the contract are making a promise to each other.\n\n- **\"for five (5) years from the date of disclosure...\"**  \n  This obligation starts when the confidential information is first shared and lasts for five years from that date.\n\n- **\"the receiving Party agrees to limit disclosure...\"**  \n  The \"receiving Party\" is the person or company who gets the confidential information. They agree to *limit* who they tell about this information.\n\n- **\"disclosure...\"**  \n  \"Disclosure\" means making the information known or sharing it in any way with someone else.\n\n**What does this mean overall?**  \nIf one party shares confidential information with the other, the person or business who gets that information cannot freely share it with others for five years. Their ability to share (\"disclose\") that information is restricted as stated by the contract. Usually, the information should only be shared with certain people (like employees or contractors who really need to know), and not with the public or competitors.\n\n**Other Key Terms (often found in such clauses):**\n\n- **Disclosing Party:** The one giving or showing the confidential information.\n- **Receiving Party:** The one getting or learning the confidential information.\n- **Confidential Information:** Any sensitive, private, or proprietary information that isn’t meant to be public. The contract should say what counts as confidential.\n- **Exclusions:** Sometimes there are exceptions, like information that's already public, or which the receiving party already knows.\n\nThis type of clause is known as a “confidentiality clause” or “non-disclosure agreement (NDA)” and is common in business relationships to protect valuable or sensitive information ([source 1](https://fynk.com/en/clauses/confidentiality-clause/), [source 3](https://www.upcounsel.com/confidentiality-agreements)).",
  "Such Confidential Information shall be returned promptly and the non-disclosing Party shall not retain": "The clause means that if you receive confidential information under the contract, you must give it back right away when asked, and you cannot keep any copies.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of each term and what it means in plain English:\n\n- **Such Confidential Information**: This refers to all information that one party has been told is confidential under the contract. This could include business plans, customer lists, financial data, trade secrets, or anything specifically marked or treated as confidential by the party who shared it [1][3][5].\n\n- **Shall be returned promptly**: \"Shall\" means this is a legal requirement, not a suggestion. \"Returned promptly\" means you have to give the confidential information back to the person or company who gave it to you as soon as they ask, without unreasonable delays [2].\n\n- **The non-disclosing Party**: In confidential agreements, there’s typically a \"Disclosing Party\" (the one sharing the information) and a \"Receiving Party\" (the one getting the information). Here, the \"non-disclosing Party\" means the person or company that received the confidential information (the Receiving Party).\n\n- **Shall not retain**: Again, \"shall\" makes this a strict rule. \"Not retain\" means you are not allowed to keep any copies, notes, or records of the confidential information after returning it [2].\n\n**Putting it all together in simple terms:**  \nIf you have been given confidential information under this contract, you have to give all that information back as soon as you are asked and you cannot keep any copies, whether paper or electronic. You must return or destroy all versions of the confidential information and not hold on to anything, unless an exception applies (like needing to keep a copy for legal reasons—sometimes allowed in more detailed contracts) [2].\n\nThis clause is meant to protect the owner of the confidential information by making sure their sensitive data isn’t held or used by others once the business relationship ends or when requested [2][3][5].",
  "this Agreement, unless independently authorized to retain such of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information under an Other": "This contract clause says that a party cannot keep (“retain”) confidential information that belongs to the other party (“Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information”) unless they are separately, specifically allowed to do so (“independently authorized … under an Other [agreement or law]”). Here is plain-English breakdown of each part:\n\n- **Agreement**: The contract you are signing.\n- **Independently authorized**: You have explicit permission, separate from this agreement—usually either through a different contract or by law.\n- **Retain**: To keep or hold onto something.\n- **Disclosing Party**: The person or company sharing confidential information.\n- **Confidential Information**: Information meant to be kept secret, such as business strategies, customer lists, or trade secrets ([source 1](https://www.contractken.com/glossary/confidentiality); [source 4](https://www.legalontech.com/contracts/confidentiality-clauses)).\n- **Under an Other [context]**: Refers to a different agreement, contract, or legal rule—not this one.\n\n**Plain English Explanation:**  \nUnless another contract or the law clearly gives you separate permission, you are not allowed to keep any confidential information you received from the other party.\n\n**Why This Matters:**  \nThe clause is trying to make sure that, when this contract ends or unless you have other legal rights, you cannot continue to hold or use the other party's confidential information. If you want to keep or use such information in the future, you must have a separate written agreement that says you can, or a legal rule that allows it.\n\n**Further context:**  \nMost confidentiality clauses work this way to legally protect sensitive information, make clear to the receiving party how long and what rights they have regarding the information, and set out what happens if the rules are broken ([source 1](https://www.contractken.com/glossary/confidentiality); [source 4](https://www.legalontech.com/contracts/confidentiality-clauses)).",
  "expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving Party shall disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information only to its": "This clause says that after the contract ends—either because it naturally expires or is ended early—the party who received confidential information must only share it with certain people. Here’s a plain English breakdown of each part and term:\n\n**1. “Expiration or termination of this Agreement”**  \n- “Expiration”: This means the contract comes to a close because the agreed time period is over, or all obligations are fulfilled as planned [4].\n- “Termination”: This means the contract ends early, before its expected finish. This can happen for reasons like both parties agreeing to end it, one side breaking (breaching) the contract, or circumstances making the agreement impossible or pointless [1][2][3][5].\n\n**2. “The receiving Party”**  \n- This refers to the person or company that got (received) confidential information during the contract.\n\n**3. “shall disclose”**  \n- “Shall” is legal language for “must.”  \n- “Disclose” means to share or reveal.\n\n**4. “the other Party’s Confidential Information”**  \n- “Other Party” is the person or company that shared its confidential information (for example: trade secrets, private business plans, customer lists).\n- “Confidential Information” covers any information labeled “confidential” or that should clearly be kept secret because it’s private or sensitive.\n\n**5. “only to its”**  \n- This starts a condition saying the receiving party is only allowed to share the confidential information with specific people (the sentence seems to be cut off, but typically this means employees or contractors who need the info for legitimate reasons and who are themselves required to keep it confidential).\n\n**In summary:**  \nWhen the contract ends—whether that’s because it expires on its own or gets ended early—the person or business that received secret information is only allowed to share that information in very limited ways, and not with just anyone. This keeps important information protected after the agreement is over.",
  "The Recipient agrees to hold all Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party in strict confidence and not to disclose such information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. The Recipient shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of unauthorized persons. This obligation shall survive termination of this Agreement and shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure.": "This contract clause says that if someone (the “Recipient”) is given confidential information by someone else (the “Disclosing Party”), the Recipient has a legal duty to keep that information secret and not share it with others unless the Disclosing Party gives written permission.\n\n**Plain English Breakdown:**\n\n- **Recipient:** The person or company receiving confidential information.\n- **Disclosing Party:** The person or company sharing the confidential information.\n- **Confidential Information:** Private or sensitive information that isn’t meant to be shared publicly. Examples can include business plans, trade secrets, financial data, or customer lists [1][4][5].\n\n**What the Recipient Must Do:**\n- **Hold in strict confidence:** The Recipient must keep the information secret and treat it as private.\n- **Not disclose to a third party:** The Recipient isn’t allowed to tell anyone else (a “third party”) about this information unless the Disclosing Party first says it’s okay in writing.\n- **Take all reasonable measures:** The Recipient has to take practical steps (like locking files and using password-protected computers) to keep the information secret so it doesn’t accidentally become public or fall into the hands of unauthorized people [2][3].\n- **Prevent public or unauthorized disclosure:** The goal is to stop the information from becoming known to the public or being accessed by people who shouldn’t have it.\n\n**How long does this duty last?**\n- Even after the contract between both parties ends, the Recipient must still keep the information confidential.\n- This duty to protect the information lasts for five years starting from the date the information was first given to the Recipient.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis clause makes it clear that the Recipient must do everything reasonable to keep the Disclosing Party’s private information secret for five years, even after their relationship ends. The Recipient can only share that information with others if they get written permission from the Disclosing Party first [3][4][5].\n\nIf any part of these requirements is broken, the clause may allow the Disclosing Party to seek legal action. This is a standard part of business contracts to protect sensitive company information [3][2].\n\n**Sources:**  \n[1] https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/definition-of-confidential-information  \n[2] https://www.legalontech.com/contracts/confidentiality-clauses  \n[3] https://www.contractken.com/glossary/confidentiality  \n[4] https://www.cobrief.app/resources/legal-glossary/definition-of-confidential-information-overview-definition-and-example/  \n[5] https://afterpattern.com/clauses/definition-of-confidential-information",
  "For tangible products": "This contract clause is about \"tangible products,\" meaning physical items you can touch and move, like equipment, furniture, or inventory—not digital goods or intellectual property[1][3][5].\n\n**Plain English Breakdown:**\n\n- **Tangible products**: These are real, physical objects (like a chair, computer, machine, or box of inventory). You can touch and see them[3][5].\n- **Contract clause purpose**: This section of the contract explains who owns, uses, or is responsible for these physical items. It often lists exactly which items are included, how they must be handled, and what happens to them when the contract ends[1].\n- **Common terms explained**:\n    - **Ownership**: Specifies who the items belong to, both during and after the contract.\n    - **Transfer**: Explains how these items are handed over from one party to another, if needed.\n    - **Use**: Sets out if, how, and by whom these items can be used while the contract is in effect.\n    - **Return**: Details any procedures for giving the items back when the contract finishes.\n    - **Inventory/List**: There may be a list attached to the contract that names all the specific items this clause covers.\n\n**Example (in plain English):**\n“If you’re buying a store and its contents, the contract might say that you’re getting all the shelves, cash registers, and stock in the back room. This part of the contract makes sure everyone knows which physical things are included, so there’s no confusion later[1][3].”\n\n**Why it matters:**  \nThis clause makes things clear so no one argues later about what physical stuff each person gets, uses, or gives back when the deal ends or if there’s a disagreement[1][3].\n\nIf you want a specific example broken down, just supply the exact contract wording and I’ll explain each part in plain English.\n\n**References:**\n1.

  "other product communication.": "The phrase \"other product communication\" on its own is incomplete and does not form a full contract clause, so its legal effect and meaning are unclear without additional context. As it stands, here’s how to understand each term in plain English:\n\n- **Other**: This means \"additional\" or \"different from previously specified.\" In contracts, it often refers to things not specifically listed earlier in the document.\n- **Product**: This is the item or service being sold, provided, licensed, or otherwise dealt with in the contract.\n- **Communication**: This refers to any form of sharing information, such as emails, calls, messages, advertising, packaging details, or instructions related to the product.\n\nIf \"other product communication\" appeared as a standalone phrase or heading in a contract, it might be intended as a category or section header, meant to cover contractual terms related to additional ways the parties might communicate about the product, beyond those already addressed.\n\nHowever, **without a full sentence or more text**, there is no enforceable obligation or clear rule. Here’s what could typically follow such a phrase in an actual contract:\n\n- Specifications about how information about the product is shared.\n- Guidelines for marketing, packaging, or customer support messaging.\n- Restrictions on what can be said about the product to third parties.\n\n**Essential point:** On its own, \"other product communication\" is too vague and incomplete to have a clear legal meaning or effect. If you are reviewing a contract and see this phrase, ask for clarification or the full text of the clause to understand its actual purpose and rules, as contract terms should always be specific to avoid misunderstandings and legal disputes [4](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/contract-clause/), [5](https://ironcladapp.com/journal/contracts/important-contract-clauses/).\n\nIf you can provide the full sentence or paragraph, I can break down the entire clause in simple language.",
  "Commercialization of the Product.": "The clause \"Commercialization of the Product\" in a contract refers to the process and conditions under which a product will be developed, marketed, and sold to customers. This clause spells out what each party must do to bring the product to market and make it available for sale or use by the public.\n\n**Plain English Breakdown of Terms:**\n\n- **Commercialization** means taking a product (it could be an invention, a piece of software, or another item) and making it available for consumers or businesses to buy or use. This includes actions like getting it ready to use, advertising it, and managing sales and distribution [3].\n- **The Product** is the specific item or service that the contract is about—it's what both parties agree to focus on bringing to market.\n\n**Common Elements Found in a Commercialization Clause:**\n\n1. **Development**: One or both parties might agree to finish designing or improving the product before it can be sold.\n2. **Marketing and Promotion**: The clause may explain who is responsible for advertising and promoting the product, and how those efforts should be made.\n3. **Manufacturing and Distribution**: It describes who will make the product, how many units will be produced, and how the product will get to buyers.\n4. **Licensing and Legal Rights**: If special rights or government permits are needed to sell the product, the clause can explain who will secure them.\n5. **Time Frames**: Often, there is a deadline or schedule for when certain steps—like a product launch—must happen [3].\n6. **Compensation**: It may state how profits or royalties (a share of earnings) will be split, so the inventor or owner gets paid for their idea [1].\n\n**Why Is This Clause Important?**\n\n- It ensures both parties know exactly what is expected and when.\n- It protects everyone’s interests by clarifying who does what, when, and who owns the product or gets paid as it is commercialized.\n- It helps avoid misunderstandings or legal disputes later [4][5].\n\n**Example Clause in Plain English:**\n\n“The parties agree that the Product will be created, marketed, and sold as described in this contract. The Company will do everything necessary—like getting permits, building the product, and finding customers—to start selling the Product by the date we have agreed on.”\n\n**Each key term explained:**\n\n- **Parties** = the people or companies making the agreement.\n- **Marketed** = advertised and promoted to customers.\n- **Distributed** = delivered or made available in stores or online.\n- **Licenses** = official permissions needed to sell the product.\n- **Royalties/Profits** = money made from selling the product, and how it is divided.\n\nThis clause is a fundamental part of contracts where a product—from an invention to a book or technology—is being launched into the marketplace, ensuring clarity and legal protection for all involved [1][3][4].",
  "connection with the Commercialization of the Product.": "The phrase “in connection with the Commercialization of the Product” is a standard contract clause that links specific rights, duties, or activities in the agreement to the act of bringing a product to market—making it available for sale or use.\n\n**Breaking Down Each Term:**\n\n- **In connection with:**  \n  This means \"related to\" or \"associated with.\" Anything described in the contract as being “in connection with” something has to be directly linked or relevant to that activity or process. In plain English: if something happens as part of or because of the activity named, it falls under this clause [4](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/contract-clause/).\n\n- **Commercialization:**  \n  This is the process of taking a product, service, or idea and turning it into something people can buy or use. Commercialization involves making a product ready and available for the market, which could include activities like manufacturing, advertising, distribution, obtaining necessary approvals, and setting up sales channels [3](https://www.cobrief.app/resources/legal-glossary/commercialization-overview-definition-and-example/), [1](https://www.contractscounsel.com/t/us/commercialisation-agreement).\n\n- **of the Product:**  \n  This specifies exactly what is being brought to market: \"the Product\" is usually a specific item defined earlier in the contract. It refers to the invention, good, or service described in the agreement [1](https://www.contractscounsel.com/t/us/commercialisation-agreement).\n\n**Plain English Explanation:**\n\nWhenever the contract mentions something happening \"in connection with the Commercialization of the Product,\" it means that those rights or responsibilities apply to anything done as part of getting the product ready to sell, actually selling it, or managing its presence in the market. This includes making the product, marketing it, shipping it, or taking steps required to offer it to customers.\n\n**Example:**\nIf a contract says, “Each party is responsible for its own costs incurred in connection with the Commercialization of the Product,” it means each side pays their own bills for anything they do to get the product into the market—such as paying for advertising, manufacturing, or shipping.\n\n**Why this clause matters:**\n- It clarifies *when* certain parts of the contract apply—specifically, during all actions tied to making and selling the product.\n- It helps avoid disputes about what costs, rights, or duties relate to the project.\n\n**Key takeaway:**  \nWhenever you see “in connection with the Commercialization of the Product,” read it as “for anything related to making and selling the product.”",
  "Materials solely in connection with the Commercialization of the Product;": "The clause “Materials solely in connection with the Commercialization of the Product” means that certain materials (such as documents, data, samples, or information) can only be used for one specific purpose: to help bring the product to market, sell it, or make it available to customers.\n\n**Explanation of Key Terms in Plain English:**\n\n- **Materials:** This usually refers to anything physical or digital—such as reports, data, prototypes, manufacturing tools, marketing materials, or confidential information—that is shared or created under the contract.\n\n- **Solely:** This word means \"only\" or \"exclusively.\" The materials discussed in this clause can *only* be used for the purpose that’s described next, which is “the Commercialization of the Product.” They cannot be used for any other purpose, such as research not related to the product, personal use, or other business deals.\n\n- **In connection with:** This phrase means “for the purpose of,” “to support,” or “related to.” It sets a link between these materials and what can be done with them.\n\n- **The Commercialization of the Product:** According to legal sources, commercialization is the process of turning a product, invention, or idea into something that’s available for sale or use in the market [1][3]. This usually includes developing the product, manufacturing it, promoting it, selling it, distributing it, and handling all steps necessary to launch it for customers to buy or use.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\nThe clause is a restriction. It says that the party using these materials is not allowed to use them for anything except activities that are part of bringing the product to market and selling it. Examples of allowed uses might include making samples for customers, creating advertisements, or getting regulatory approvals for sale. Using the materials for unrelated purposes (like selling them to someone else or using them for a different project) would not be allowed under this clause.\n\n**Why is this important?**\nThis type of clause is meant to protect the interests of the product’s owner. By limiting use to only commercialization, it helps ensure that sensitive information or specialized materials aren’t misused or leaked for purposes that could hurt the product’s value or the owner’s rights.\n\n**Summary:**  \nOnly use the specified materials for tasks directly related to launching, selling, and supporting the product in the market—nothing else [1][3].\n\n---\n**References:**\n1.

  "Tangible product: a bite-sized finance explainer with multilingual support": "This contract clause says that the \"tangible product\" being provided is a \"bite-sized finance explainer with multilingual support.\" Here’s what each term means in simple language:\n\n- **Tangible product**: In legal terms, \"tangible\" means something physical that you can actually touch or hold in your hands—like a book, piece of equipment, or packaged item [1][3][5]. However, sometimes businesses use \"tangible product\" a bit loosely. If the finance explainer is, for example, a printed booklet or a flashcard deck, that would be a classic tangible product. If it’s just a digital file (like a PDF or video), technically, that’s not \"tangible\"—it's intangible. It's important to confirm whether the explainer is physically printed/packaged or only available online. Based strictly on contract wording, it should be something you can physically possess [1][3][5].\n\n- **Bite-sized finance explainer**: \"Bite-sized\" means the product is short, simple, and easy to understand—probably covering just one topic or concept in a quick, clear format. A \"finance explainer\" is educational content that makes a financial concept easier to understand, such as how interest works, what a budget is, or how to read a bank statement.\n\n- **With multilingual support**: This means the explainer will be available in more than one language, or at least accompanied by translations or language aids. The goal is for people who speak various languages to use and understand the product.\n\n**Plain English summary:**  \nThe contract is promising you something you can physically hold—a simple, short educational resource that explains a finance concept, and it will be available in multiple languages. For example, this could be a printed card or pamphlet (tangible) that breaks down a financial topic and includes content or instructions in several languages.\n\n**Extra detail:**  \nIf you’re not sure whether the explainer is a real, physical object or just a digital download, ask for clarification, because \"tangible\" has a specific legal meaning: it should be something physical, not digital [1][3][5].\n\n**Sources:**  \n[1] https://www.cobrief.app/resources/legal-glossary/tangible-assets-overview-definition-and-example/  \n[3] https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/tangible-products  \n[5] https://www.cobrief.app/resources/legal-glossary/tangible-personal-property-overview-definition-and-example/",
  "achieving a passing result on the on-line tests after each module.": "This clause means that, in order to move forward or meet your obligations under the contract, you must successfully pass the online test that comes after each module (or section) of the training or course.\n\nBreaking down the terms in plain English:\n\n- Achieving a passing result: You need to get a score on the test that meets the minimum required standard. \"Passing\" means not just taking the test, but earning a score high enough to be considered successful under the rules set by whoever created the course or program.\n- On-line tests: These are tests or quizzes taken over the internet, not in person or on paper. They are usually accessed through a computer or mobile device.\n- After each module: The course or training is split up into parts called \"modules.\" At the end of each module, there is a test covering what was just taught.\n  \nIn summary: Each time you finish a part (module) of the course, you have to take and pass an online test to keep progressing or to fulfill what the contract requires from you.\n\nA \"contract clause\" like this sets a clear requirement or rule, stating what someone must do to meet their responsibilities under the agreement. If you do not pass the test after a module, you may not be able to complete the course, receive a certificate, or meet other obligations outlined in the contract [1][3].",
  "By _______________________": "The clause \"By _______________________\" is a signature or execution line in a contract, where the person or party who agrees to the contract is expected to sign or name themselves. This line is essential for the agreement to be legally binding.\n\n**Plain English Explanation:**\n- \"By\" is typically followed by a blank line because this is where the name of the person or the company signing the contract goes.\n- It often appears near the end of a contract, sometimes with other lines for printed name, title, date, or signature.\n\n**Key Terms and Concepts Explained:**\n- **\"By\":** This word signals who is acting or agreeing on behalf of a party. It's shorthand for \"signed by:\" or \"executed by:.\"\n- **Blank Line:** The empty space is to be filled in by the signer. This may be an individual’s name (if it’s a person), or the name and title of a company representative (if it’s a business).\n- **Purpose:** This line shows which person or entity has agreed to the terms of the contract. Without someone filling in this line, the contract may not be enforceable, because there is no clear record of who committed to it.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n- Every contract needs clear evidence of who is entering the agreement. The \"By _______________________\" line provides that proof.\n- Once signed, the person or company is legally bound by all the contract’s terms and conditions, as defined in the rest of the document [1][3][4].\n- If a legal dispute arises later, this line shows the authority and identity of the signer.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- Sometimes, underneath or to the side of \"By _______________________\", there are other lines for \"Title,\" \"Date,\" or \"Printed Name.\" These clarify further who is signing and in what official capacity.\n- Only an authorized person should sign here; for a business, this means someone who has legal authority to commit the company.\n\nIn summary, \"By _______________________\" is where a party officially agrees to the contract, and filling it in correctly is essential for the contract to be valid.",
  "By _____________________": "The clause “By _____________________” is usually a blank line at the end of a contract where a person is meant to sign or print their name, along with the date, to show their agreement to the terms of the document.\n\nHere’s what each part means in plain English:\n- \"By\": This word is short for \"signed by\" or \"agreed to by.\" It introduces the person who is making the agreement official.\n- The blank line: This space is for the person’s name or signature. Signing here means that person agrees to follow all the rules and conditions stated in the contract.\n\nWhy it’s important:\n- When you sign your name on this line, you are agreeing to everything in the contract. This makes the contract a legally binding document, and you are responsible for following its terms ([1](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/contract-clause), [2](https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/entire-contract/)).\n- Only the people who sign in the “By” section are considered parties to the contract. If you don’t sign, you are not legally bound by the contract.\n\nIf you see “By _____________________,” do not sign unless you have read and understood all parts of the contract. By signing, you confirm that you accept everything the document says and will do what it requires.",
  "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------": "A contract clause is a specific section within a legal agreement that sets out particular terms—laying out what each party must do (obligations), may do (rights), or cannot do (restrictions), and what happens if things don’t go as planned. Every word or phrase in a clause has a legal effect; understanding these terms makes clear what each side has agreed to, so there are no surprises later.\n\nHere’s how to break down a typical contract clause in plain English:\n\n**1. What is a clause?**  \nA clause is just one piece or section of a contract. Think of it like a rule in a game: it explains a specific point that everyone signing the contract must follow. Each clause covers a different topic in the agreement—one might talk about payment, another about delivery dates, and so on[3][4].\n\n**2. Common parts of a clause:**  \n- **Scope and Definitions**: This explains what the clause covers, and clearly defines important words. For example, “goods” might specifically mean “500 blue widgets” so there’s no confusion about what’s being exchanged[1].\n- **Obligations/Commitments**: This spells out what each party has to do. For example, “Party A will deliver the blue widgets to Party B by July 1.” It’s basically a to-do list[1].\n- **Rights and Privileges**: This section says what each party can expect to receive or do under the contract, like “Party B has the right to inspect the goods upon delivery”[1].\n- **Conditions and Contingencies**: This addresses “what happens if” scenarios, such as delays or unexpected problems. For example, “If delivery is late due to a natural disaster, Party A is not liable for damages”[1].\n- **Remedies and Consequences**: If someone breaks the rule (doesn’t do what they promised), this part explains what happens next—like penalties, ways to fix the problem, or even ending the agreement[1].\n\n**3. Types of clauses (for context):**\n- **Operative clauses**: The main rules of the agreement—what’s being exchanged and what each party has to do[3].\n- **Boilerplate clauses**: Standard, often-repeated language (like what court resolves disagreements or how to give official notice)[3].\n- **Restrictive clauses**: Limit what one or both parties can do, such as agreeing not to share confidential information[3].\n\n**4. Why are clauses important?**  \nClauses help make sure that everyone understands exactly what has been agreed to. They reduce the chances of confusion or arguments later because everything is spelled out in writing. If a dispute arises, the clause is what a judge (or arbitrator) will look at to decide what should happen next[2][4].\n\n**5. Every word counts:**  \nIn contract law, every word can have weight. If a term is unclear, it could be open to interpretation—which might lead to arguments or legal action. That’s why clauses are often carefully drafted and packed with definitions.\n\nIf you have a specific contract clause to interpret, you can provide the text, and each part can be explained in the same “plain English” fashion—unpacking the terms, obligations, rights, and what happens if things go wrong.\n\n**References:**  \n[1] https://www.top.legal/en/knowledge/common-contract-clauses  \n[2] https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/entire-contract/  \n[3] https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/contract-clause/  \n[4] https://enty.io/blog/what-is-a-clause-in-a-contract-definition-and-examples",
  "The Recipient agrees to hold all Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party in strict confidence and not to disclose such information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. The Recipient shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of unauthorized persons.

This obligation shall survive termination of this Agreement and shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure.": "This contract clause is a confidentiality agreement, meaning it sets clear rules for how one party (“Recipient”) must handle sensitive information shared by another party (“Disclosing Party”). Here’s a plain English breakdown for each part and every key term:\n\n- **“Recipient”**: The person or company receiving confidential information.\n- **“Disclosing Party”**: The person or company sharing confidential information.\n\n**1. Hold in strict confidence:**  \nThe Recipient promises to treat all confidential information as secret. That means not telling anyone else (“third party”) about it unless they get written permission from the Disclosing Party first [1][2][4].\n\n**2. Not to disclose without written consent:**  \nThe Recipient cannot share the confidential information with anyone outside their organization unless the Disclosing Party has agreed in writing. “Written consent” is formal permission given on paper or electronically.\n\n**3. Take all reasonable measures to protect secrecy:**  \nThe Recipient is responsible for doing whatever is reasonably possible to keep the information secret. This can include things like:\n- Keeping files in secure locations  \n- Using passwords or encryption  \n- Limiting who inside their company can access the information [2][4]\n\n**4. Prevent public domain release or access by unauthorized persons:**  \nThe Recipient must make sure the confidential information does not become public (known as “falling into the public domain”) or end up with people who aren’t supposed to see it (“unauthorized persons”) [2][4].\n\n- **“Public domain”:** Information that is known and available to the general public.\n\n- **“Unauthorized persons”:** Anyone who isn’t specifically allowed (by the Disclosing Party) to know the confidential information.\n\n**5. Obligation survives termination for five years:**  \nEven after the contract or relationship between the parties ends (“termination of this Agreement”), the Recipient **must continue to protect the confidential information for five more years** from the date it was originally shared. “Survive termination” means the rule still applies after the contract is over [2][4].\n\n- **“From the date of disclosure”**: The five-year countdown starts on the day the Recipient is first given the confidential information.\n\n**Summary in everyday language:**  \nIf you are the Recipient, you have to keep the information you get totally secret, only share it if you get written permission, do everything reasonable to keep it safe, make sure it doesn’t become public or end up with someone it shouldn’t, and keep these promises for five years—even after your official relationship with the Disclosing Party ends.\n\n**Reference for plain language and context:**  \n- fynk.com: Confidentiality clauses explained [1]\n- ContractKen: Elements of confidentiality clauses [2]\n- LegalOn: Review and obligations in confidentiality clauses [4]",

  "Neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, data, or use, incurred by either Party or any third party, whether in an action in contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with the performance or breach of this Agreement, even if the Party was advised of the possibility of such damages. The aggregate cumulative liability of either Party to the other relating to this Agreement shall not exceed the total amount paid or payable by Customer to Supplier under this Agreement in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.": "This contract clause limits how much the parties (the people or companies signing the contract) can be held responsible if something goes wrong. In plain English, it says that neither side can be forced to pay for certain types of damages, and even if they do owe something, there's a maximum amount one can claim from the other.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each part means:\n\n**1. Limit on Types of Damages (What kind of losses you *can’t* claim):**\n- The clause says neither party will be responsible for paying the other for these types of damages:\n  - **Indirect damages:** Losses that aren’t a direct result of the problem but happen as a side effect (e.g., if a late delivery causes you to lose another business deal).\n  - **Incidental damages:** Minor, secondary losses that happen because of the main issue (e.g., extra shipping costs from a delay).\n  - **Consequential damages:** Losses that result from special circumstances, usually foreseeable but not a direct result (e.g., lost profits from being unable to operate as normal after an equipment failure).\n  - **Special damages:** Similar to consequential damages, unique to the specific situation (e.g., a unique penalty in another contract because of this problem).\n  - **Punitive damages:** Extra payments meant to punish the other party for wrongdoing, not compensate for a specific loss.\n\n- It gives examples, including but not limited to: lost profits, lost revenue, lost data, or lost use. So, if a problem causes you to lose potential income, information, or the ability to use something, you generally can't get compensated for those things under this contract.\n\n**2. No Matter Who is Involved or How the Issue Came Up:**\n- The limitation applies whether the claim is because of:\n  - A broken contract (\"contract\"),\n  - A legal wrong like negligence (\"tort\"),\n  - Strict liability (responsibility even if no one is at fault),\n  - Or almost any other legal theory.\n\n**3. Even if the Other Side Was Warned:**\n- This applies even if the responsible party was told that these kinds of damages might happen. For example, if you warned the supplier that a delay would cost you big profits, they still won’t pay those lost profits.\n\n**4. Liability Cap (The maximum one side can owe the other):**\n- If one party *is* found liable (responsible), the most they would ever have to pay is limited to the total amount the customer has paid (or must pay) to the supplier in the twelve months before the problem started.\n  - For instance: If you paid the supplier $10,000 in the past year before the issue, you can't claim more than $10,000—even if your actual losses are higher.\n\n**Why is this here?**\n- It protects both sides from huge, unpredictable financial losses—businesses often use these clauses to make risks manageable and avoid lawsuits over things like lost profits or special circumstances [[1](https://www.cobrief.app/resources/legal-glossary/liability-overview-definition-and-example/), [3](https://docue.com/en-gb/legal-hub/liability-clauses), [5](https://velawood.com/understanding-basic-contracts-liability-limitations/)].\n\n**In summary:** If you want to claim damages, you’re limited to getting back your direct financial losses, up to a capped amount (usually what you paid in the last year). You can’t claim for special, indirect, or punitive damages, and you can’t get more than the stated cap, no matter how big your losses were.",

Below is a breakdown of the main parts and terms in straightforward English, with each legal concept fully explained:\n\n**1. Who is Involved**\n- **Owner:** The app is owned by the company listed (address in Grozny, Russia, contact email provided).\n- **User:** Anyone who uses the app—either a consumer (someone using it for personal reasons) or a business (using it for business purposes).\n\n**2. Applicability of Terms**\n- Some rules only apply to certain types of users (e.g., only to consumers, or only to business users). When this happens, the contract will make this clear. If it doesn’t say otherwise, the rule applies to everyone.\n\n**3. Using the App (Terms of Use)**\n- Unless stated otherwise, the basic rules listed here apply to everyone using the app.\n- In some situations, extra rules may apply, and these will be pointed out in the app or in the relevant section.\n- By using the app, users confirm they:\n  - Are not restricted based on being a consumer or business user.\n  - Are not in a country under a US embargo or on a “terrorist-supporting” list.\n  - Are not on any US government restricted/prohibited persons lists.\n\n**4. Content and Intellectual Property**\n- All content (e.g., images, text, data) on the app belongs to the app owner or its licensors (people or companies who provide rights to use content).\n- The owner tries hard to make sure all content is lawful, but if there’s a problem, users should report it using the contact info.\n- **All rights reserved:** Users generally can’t copy, download, modify, share, sell, or use the app’s content in any way except as necessary to use the app. If the app specifically allows downloads or sharing for personal, non-commercial use, users must follow any rules (such as keeping copyright notices).\n\n**5. Access to Third-Party Resources**\n- The app may provide links to other (third-party) resources. The owner doesn’t control these or guarantee their content is accurate or available. Use them at your own risk.\n\n**6. Acceptable Use**\n- Use the app only for legal purposes and as intended by these terms.\n- The owner can block access, terminate service, or report users to authorities if they:\n  - Break laws or these terms.\n  - Infringe on anyone’s rights.\n  - Harm the owner’s interests.\n  - Offend the owner or others.\n\n**7. Buying Products (Terms and Conditions of Sale)**\n- Some products on the app require payment. Prices, details, and terms for each product are shown in the app and may change without notice.\n- **Product Descriptions:** Provided as accurately as possible, but images or sounds are for reference only—no guarantees they’re 100% accurate.\n- **Payment:** Accepted payment methods are shown during checkout. Payments are handled by third-party providers (app doesn’t store your credit card info). If payment fails, the owner doesn’t have to deliver the product, and any costs from a failed payment are the user’s responsibility.\n- **Purchasing via App Store:** If bought through the Apple or Google app stores, the app store’s terms apply and override these terms if there's a conflict. Check and accept the app store’s terms before buying.\n\n**8. Retention of Usage Rights**\n- Users get rights to use a purchased product only after the owner has received full payment.\n\n**9. Delivery and Trial Periods**\n- Services will be provided within the timeframe shown in the app or communicated before purchase.\n- **Trial Periods:** Some products can be tested for free for a short period (details are given in the app). If you don’t cancel before the end of the trial, you’ll be charged for the full product.\n\n**10. Subscriptions**\n- Subscriptions mean you pay regularly for ongoing access to a product or service.\n- If subscribing via Apple ID, Apple’s rules apply (e.g., auto-renewal unless cancelled at least 24 hours before end of current period). You manage and cancel your subscription through Apple.\n\n**11. Limitation of Liability and Warranties**\n- **For Australian Users:** The contract doesn’t remove any non-excludable legal rights under Australian consumer law. The owner’s liability is limited to fixing the problem or covering the cost of doing so.\n- **For US Users:** The app and its services are offered “as is”; use at your own risk. The owner denies any guarantees about accuracy, performance, or that the service will be error-free. The owner isn’t responsible for indirect or special damages, or for losses due to, for example, hacking or viruses. If the owner is found liable, the maximum amount they’ll pay is what you’ve paid them in the past year or during your contract (whichever is less). Some legal rights and protections vary by state and may override these limits.\n- **Indemnification:** If a user causes the owner any loss (for example, by violating these terms or the law), the user will pay the owner’s legal fees and other costs related to such loss.\n\n**12. Other Important Provisions**\n- **No Waiver:** If the owner doesn’t enforce a rule right away, they can still enforce it later.\n- **Service Interruption:** The owner can suspend the service for updates or for other reasons, and isn’t responsible for interruptions beyond their control (like power outages or natural disasters).\n- **No Resale:** Users cannot resell or duplicate the service unless given written permission.\n- **Privacy Policy:** The privacy policy governs use of personal data.\n- **Intellectual Property:** All trademarks, logos, and similar content belong to the owner unless stated otherwise.\n\n**13. Changing the Terms**\n- The owner can change these terms at any time and will notify users. If you keep using the app, you accept the new terms. If you don’t accept changes, stop using the service.\n\n**14. Assignment**\n- The owner can transfer their rights and responsibilities under the contract to someone else. Users can’t do this without written permission.\n\n**15. Severability**\n- If any part of the contract is found invalid or unenforceable by a court, the rest of the contract still applies. For EU users, invalid sections are replaced with valid provisions if possible, and the whole contract only fails if the dropped section was essential.\n\n**16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction**\n- Unless you’re a European consumer with stronger local rights, the contract is governed by the laws of the owner’s location (Russia), and any legal disputes are handled in their courts. Exceptions are made for European consumers and those in Switzerland, Norway, or Iceland, who may have different protections.\n\n**17. Definitions**\n- The section at the end defines key terms: \n  - The \"Application\" is the app or website.\n  - \"Agreement\" is the legal contract between user and owner.\n  - \"Owner\" is the company/person running the app.\n  - \"Product\" means goods or services offered.\n  - \"User\" is you, the person using the app.\n  - \"Consumer\" is a user using the app for personal (not business) reasons.\n\nThis is a high-level summary and explanation of terms for non-lawyers; specific legal questions should be addressed to a qualified attorney. For reference, the definition and enforceability of contracts depend on elements like offer, acceptance, and mutual agreement, as explained in legal guides ([1](https://www.korumlegal.com/blog/mastering-legal-contracts-key-contract-law-terms-and-agreements-explained), [2](https://ironcladapp.com/journal/contract-management/contract-terms/), [3](https://www.pandadoc.com/blog/contract-terminology/), [4](https://barprephero.com/legal-terms/contracts/), [5](https://www.gatekeeperhq.com/blog/contract-terminology)). If you need clarification on any specific section, please indicate which part.",
  "Notices\n(a) Any notice  or other  communication  required  or permitted  to be delivered  pursuant \nto this Agreement  will be deemed  to have been well and sufficiently  given if in writing \nand delivered  or transmitted  by facsimile  addressed  as follows:\n(i) if to Glamis:\nSuite  310-5190  Neil Road \nReno,  Nevada  89502\nTelecopier: (775)  827-5044\nAttention: Charles  A.

Dale Corman\n(b) Any  such notice,  direction  or other  instrument,  whether  delivered  or transmitted  \nby facsimile  transmission,  will be deemed  to have been given  at the time and on the date \non which  it was delivered  to or received  in the office  of the addressee,  as the case may be, \nif delivered  or transmitted  prior to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific  time)  on a Business  Day or at 9:00 \na.m. (Pacific  time) on the next succeeding  Business  Day if delivered  or transmitted \nsubsequent  to such  time;\n(c) Either  party  hereto  may change  its address  for service  from time to time by notice  \ngiven  to the other  party  hereto  in accordance  with the foregoing;  and\n(d) Any  notice,  direction  or other instrument  delivered  under  this Agreement  will be \nsigned  by one or more  duly authorized  officers  of the party  delivering  it.": "This contract clause explains how the parties must send formal written messages (called \"notices\") to each other so the communications are valid and recognized under the agreement. Here’s what each part means in plain English, with every legal or technical term clarified:\n\n(a) How to Send a Notice  \n- Any official notice or other communication that has to be given under this contract must be in writing. This means you cannot simply call or tell the other party informally.\n- The notice should be delivered either in person (physically handed over or mailed) or sent by facsimile (also known as \"fax,\" a technology for sending documents electronically using a phone line).\n- Each party has a specific address and contact person for notices:\n  - If you are sending to \"Glamis\": use the specified Nevada address and fax number; address it to Charles A. Jeannes.\n  - If you are sending to \"Western Copper\": use the specified Vancouver address and fax number; address it to F. Dale Corman.\n\n(b) When a Notice Counts as Given  \n- A notice is considered officially received at the exact time and date when it reaches the recipient’s office, if it arrives before 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on a regular business day (i.e., Monday–Friday, not holidays).\n- If the notice arrives after 5:00 p.m. or on a non-business day, it's treated as being received at 9:00 a.m. on the next business day.  \n  For example, if you fax something at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, it will be treated as received at 9:00 a.m. on Monday.\n\n(c) Changing Where Notices are Sent  \n- Either party can change the address (or fax number) where it wants to receive notices. However, to make this change official, the party must send a new written notice to the other side using the same process described above.\n\n(d) Who Can Sign Notices  \n- Any notice must be signed by an authorized officer (a person who has legal authority to represent the company) on behalf of the party sending it.\n\n**Additional Context and Importance:**  \nA \"notice clause\" like this is common in contracts to prevent disputes about whether a communication was properly sent and received. It spells out exactly how, when, and to whom notices must be given, so both sides know the rules and can prove they followed them if there’s ever a disagreement [1][2][3][4]. If you don’t follow these rules, your notice may not count legally, which can impact your rights under the contract.\n\n**Key Terms Explained:**  \n- \"Notice\": An official written message required by the contract.\n- \"Facsimile\"/\"Telecopier\": Fax.\n- \"Addressed as follows\": Sent to the specific office, person, and contact info listed.\n- \"Business Day\": Monday to Friday, excluding holidays.\n- \"Duly authorized officer\": Someone with legal authority to act for the company.\n- \"Deemed\": Treated as (legally considered).\n\nIn short, this clause tells you how to officially communicate important messages under the contract so there’s a clear, legal record and no confusion about when a notice was properly sent or received ([1], [2], [3], [4]).",
  "sentence_transformers": "The phrase “sentence_transformers” is not a standard contract clause. Instead, it refers to a type of artificial intelligence tool used to process and analyze sentences, particularly in the context of working with contracts or legal language.\n\nBreaking down the term for a non-lawyer:\n\n- **“Sentence_transformers”**: This is a technical term from the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. A sentence transformer is a computer program that takes entire sentences or paragraphs and turns them into a mathematical form (“vectors” or “embeddings”). This process helps computers understand the meaning or similarity between sentences.\n\n- **Use in contracts**: In legal work, especially when automatically reviewing or classifying contract clauses, a sentence transformer model can quickly analyze large amounts of contract text and categorize or compare clauses efficiently. For example, a sentence transformer might help identify all the confidentiality clauses in hundreds of contracts, even if they use different wording [source 1](https://dataloop.ai/library/model/scholarly360_setfit-contracts-clauses/), [source 3 (PDF)](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3423/paper7.pdf).\n\n- **Not a legal clause**: This is not a rule, right, obligation, or provision that would appear in a contract to regulate behavior or set terms between parties. Instead, “sentence_transformers” refers to the underlying technology that can help lawyers and businesses organize, search, or summarize contract contents.\n\n- **Context in legal work**: Tools using sentence transformers may support contract drafting, review, and analysis—but they do not themselves establish or alter legal rights or duties [source 1](https://dataloop.ai/library/model/scholarly360_setfit-contracts-clauses/).\n\nIn summary: “sentence_transformers” is not a contract clause but an AI tool used for processing the language in contracts. It helps legal professionals manage and understand large volumes of contract text more efficiently, but does not itself appear in contracts or create legal obligations.",
  "{'id': 'clause_58531', 'text': 'Each of the parties agrees that for five (5) years from the date of disclosure, the receiving Party agrees to limit disclosure of the disclosing'}": "This clause is a confidentiality agreement, which means both sides promise not to share certain private information they receive from each other for five years after it's given to them.\n\nBreaking it down in plain English:\n\n- **\"Each of the parties agrees...\"**: Both sides who sign this contract are making this promise. Neither one is excluded.\n- **\"for five (5) years from the date of disclosure,\"**: Starting from the date the information is given (shared) by one side, the other side must keep it private for five years. “Disclosure” means the sharing or revealing of confidential information.\n- **\"the receiving Party agrees to limit disclosure...\"**: The “receiving Party” is the one who receives confidential information from the other side (“disclosing Party”). They promise not to share that information with people or organizations who are not supposed to have it.\n\n**What is a confidentiality clause?**\nA confidentiality clause (or NDA) is a part of a contract that requires people to keep private information secret and not share it with others. It protects things like business secrets, personal data, or trade secrets from being made public or given to competitors. This protection often continues even after a project or job is over [1](https://fynk.com/en/clauses/confidentiality-clause), [3](https://www.upcounsel.com/confidentiality-agreements).\n\n**Key terms explained:**\n- **Parties:** The people or companies involved in the contract.\n- **Disclosing Party:** The person or company giving the confidential information.\n- **Receiving Party:** The person or company getting the confidential information.\n- **Disclosure:** When confidential information is shared with someone.\n- **Limit disclosure:** Only let certain people know the information, usually those who need it to do their job, and don’t share with anyone else.\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThis clause is intended to make sure that any private information one party shares with the other does not get shared with outsiders for a set period (in this case, five years) [1](https://fynk.com/en/clauses/confidentiality-clause), [4](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/confidentiality-agreements).\n\nIf the clause continued, it likely specifies further details—such as how information must be kept safe, any exceptions (like if required by law), and what counts as “confidential information.”\n\nIf you have more of the clause or specific wording, providing it can help clarify the responsibilities or any exceptions included.",
  "selected_index = options.index(choice)\n    selected_text = str(results[selected_index][\"clause_text\"])\n    selected_id = results[selected_index][\"clause_id\"]": "This is not a legal contract clause, but instead a piece of Python computer code. Here’s what it does, step by step, in plain English:\n\n- **selected_index = options.index(choice)**\n  - This line finds the position (called the \"index\") of a specific item (`choice`) within a list of possible items (`options`). For example, if `options` is [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"] and `choice` is \"B\", then `selected_index` would be 1, because in programming, counting usually starts at zero: [\"A\" (0), \"B\" (1), \"C\" (2)].\n\n- **selected_text = str(results[selected_index][\"clause_text\"])**\n  - This line looks up information in another structure (probably a list of dictionaries) called `results`. It uses the index we just found to get the data related to the selected option. From this data, it pulls the value stored under `\"clause_text\"`, converts it into text (in case it isn’t already), and saves it as `selected_text`.\n\n- **selected_id = results[selected_index][\"clause_id\"]**\n  - Similarly, this line grabs the value stored under `\"clause_id\"` from the same place in the `results` structure, so that you also have the unique identifier for the chosen clause.\n\n**In plain English:**  \nThis set of instructions takes a user’s selected choice, finds that choice in a list to determine its position, and then fetches both the full text and identification number for the corresponding contract clause from another dataset.\n\n**Definitions of key terms:**\n- **Index:** The position of something in a list, starting from zero.\n- **List:** An ordered sequence of items (like a numbered checklist).\n- **Dictionary (in programming):** A collection of data where each value is labeled (like a spreadsheet with columns \"clause_text\" and \"clause_id\").\n- **String (`str`):** A piece of text.\n- **Selected clause:** The specific part of a contract someone is interested in.\n\nIf you have a real legal contract clause (instead of code), please provide it, and I can explain the legal terms in simple language. This explanation is for code that helps manage or reference contract clauses, not for legal language itself.",

Commencement Date**\n\nThis is the official “start date” for all services described in the clause.

  "{'id': 'clause_73038', 'text': 'The recipient Party shall accord the Confidential Information disclosed by the disclosing Party with at least as careful treatment as'}": "This contract clause requires that when one party (the \"recipient\") receives confidential information from another party (the \"disclosing party\"), the recipient must protect that information with at least as much care as they use to protect their own confidential information.\n\nBreaking down each part in plain English:\n\n- **Recipient Party**: This is the person or company getting the confidential information.\n- **Disclosing Party**: This is the person or company sharing the confidential information.\n- **Confidential Information**: This means any sensitive, valuable, or private data the disclosing party wants to keep secret. Examples could include business plans, client lists, technology, trade secrets, or financial information. What counts as confidential is usually defined elsewhere in the contract [1][3][4].\n- **Shall Accord ... with at least as careful treatment as**: The recipient promises to protect the confidential information at a minimum as carefully as they protect their own secrets. If they have particularly strict security for their own data, they must use at least that level of protection for the other party’s information too.\n\n**In summary:**  \nIf you receive confidential information under this clause, you are legally required to keep it safe and secret, using at least the same safeguards you use for your own confidential information. Failing to do so could mean you are breaking the contract and responsible for any damages [1][2][4].\n\n**Context and common terms (for clarity):**\n- This clause is part of a \"confidentiality clause,\" often found in business contracts, to prevent sensitive information from being shared without permission [1][2][4].\n- Obligations often include not sharing the information with outsiders, restricting access to only those who need to know, and using the information only as allowed by the contract [1][2].\n- There are sometimes exceptions, like information that is already public or required to be disclosed by law [1][2][4].\n\nReferences:  \n[1]: ContractKen - Confidentiality Clause overview  \n[2]: Fynk - Confidentiality Clause explained  \n[3]: Law Insider - Definition of Confidential Information  \n[4]: LegalOn - Overview of confidentiality clauses",
  "{'id': 'clause_136053', 'text': 'Such Confidential Information shall be returned promptly and the non-disclosing Party shall not retain'}": "This contract clause means that if one party (the \"non-disclosing party\") receives information that is meant to be kept confidential (\"Confidential Information\"), that information must be given back right away upon request or at the end of the agreement, and the non-disclosing party is not allowed to keep copies of it.\n\n**Breakdown of terms:**\n\n- **Confidential Information**: This refers to any information shared under the agreement that is supposed to be kept secret. It usually includes business secrets, technical data, financial information, proprietary technology, or any other data marked as confidential, and does not include public information or things already known to the recipient ([2](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/definition-of-confidential-information), [3](https://www.legalontech.com/contracts/confidentiality-clauses)).\n\n- **Shall be returned promptly**: This means that when asked (or when the contract ends), the party holding the confidential information must give it back to the original owner (\"disclosing party\") without unnecessary delay.\n\n- **The non-disclosing party**: This is likely a typographical error or incomplete phrase. Normally, contracts refer to the \"receiving party\"—the person or company getting the confidential information. Here, it likely means the party that didn't originally disclose the information and who now holds it.\n\n- **Shall not retain**: This means the receiving party must not keep any copies, records, or versions of the confidential information after returning it—it all must go back to the original owner or be properly destroyed.\n\n**In plain English:**  \nIf you get secret information from someone else under this contract, you have to give it all back to them quickly when they ask or when your business together ends. You are not allowed to keep any copies or records of that information after you return it.\n\nThis kind of clause is standard in contracts to ensure sensitive information does not stay with people who no longer need it and to protect business secrets ([1](https://fynk.com/en/clauses/confidentiality-clause), [3](https://www.legalontech.com/contracts/confidentiality-clauses)).",
  "be void or unenforceable,  such determination  will not be deemed  to affect  or impair  the validity  \nof any other  part of this Agreement.\nI62W.3": "If any part of this agreement is found to be invalid (void) or cannot be enforced (unenforceable), that decision will not affect or weaken the rest of the agreement.\n\n**Plain English Breakdown of Every Key Term:**\n\n- **Void:** If a part of the contract is “void,” it means it is not legally valid from the start, as if it never existed. For example, if a term requires something illegal, that term is void and has no effect [1][2][3].\n- **Unenforceable:** If a part is “unenforceable,” it can be a valid agreement, but for some reason, the court will not enforce it. This could happen if a term is too vague or doesn't meet legal requirements, like not being in writing when the law requires it [1][2][3][4].\n- **Determination:** This refers to a conclusion or judgment—usually by a court—that a part of the contract is void or unenforceable.\n- **Not be deemed to affect or impair:** This means that just because one part is found invalid or unenforceable, it does not “count against” or weaken the remaining parts.\n- **Validity:** This refers to whether something is legally acceptable and effective.\n\n**What the Clause Does:**  \nIf a single section or term in the contract is struck down (because it’s void or unenforceable), this does not make the rest of the contract invalid. Instead, the rest of the agreement stays in full effect as if the problematic term never existed. This is a common type of clause called a “severability clause,” designed to keep the agreement standing even if a problem is found with any one part.\n\n**Why It’s Important:**  \nWithout this kind of clause, if one part of a contract were found invalid or couldn’t be enforced, it might put the entire contract at risk. This clause protects the rest of the agreement from being automatically canceled just because of one issue.\n\n**Illustrative Example:**  \nSuppose a contract says, “This contract is governed by the laws of Planet Mars.” If a court finds that term void (since there are no Mars laws!), the rest of the contract—maybe about payment, services, etc.—will still stand because of this clause.\n\n**Source references:**  \n[1] Study.com – [Valid, Void, Voidable & Unenforceable Contracts](https://study.com/learn/lesson/valid-void-voidable-unenforceable-contracts.html)  \n[2] O'Flaherty Law – [When is a Contract Unenforceable?](https://www.oflaherty-law.com/learn-about-law/when-is-a-contract-unenforceable)  \n[3] Lawpath – [Difference Between Voidable and Unenforceable Contracts](https://lawpath.com.au/blog/difference-between-voidable-and-unenforceable-contracts)  \n[4] Cornell Law – [Unenforceable | Wex | US Law | LII](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/unenforceable)"
